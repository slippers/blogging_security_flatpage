# blogging_security_flatpage
making a site that does markdown editing of content via blogging and flatpages.  coupled with some security.

combine these flask packages with a single bootstrap default layout. 
* flask-sqlalchemy
* flask-security
* flask-blogging
* flask-nav
* flask-flatpage
* flask-bootstrap
* flask-admin

# notes

overriding the templates to integrate the flask-blogging features seems hacky.  if the default templates change in the
future the overrides might fail.
