{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.
Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling.
You can find additional information about template inheritance at
http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#template-inheritance #}

{%- extends "bootstrap/base.html" %}

{# We also set a default title, usually because we might forget to set one.
In our sample app, we will most likely just opt not to change it #}

{% block title %}Sample App for Flask-Bootstrap{% endblock %}

{# While we are at it, we also enable fixes for legacy browsers. First we
import the necessary macros: #}

{% import "bootstrap/fixes.html" as fixes %}

{# Loads some of the macros included with Flask-Bootstrap. We are using the
utils module here to automatically render Flask's flashed messages in a
bootstrap friendly manner #}
{% import "bootstrap/utils.html" as utils %}


{# Then, inside the head block, we apply these. To not replace the header,
``super()`` is used: #}
{% block head %}
{{super()}}
{#- Docs: http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/macros.html#fixes
The sample application already contains the required static files. #}
{{fixes.ie8()}}
{%- endblock %}

{# Adding our own CSS files is also done here. Check the documentation at
http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html#available-blocks
for an overview. #}
{% block styles -%}
{{super()}}
<link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href="{{ url_for('static', filename='tango.css') }}">


{% endblock %}

{# Finally, round things out with navigation #}
{% block navbar %}
{{nav.secnavbar.render()}}
{% endblock %}

{# Inside the ``content`` is where you should place most of your own stuff.
This will keep scripts at the page end and a navbar you add on later
intact. #}

{% block content %}
{%- with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=True) %}
{%- if messages %}
{{utils.flashed_messages(messages)}}
{%- endif %}
{%- endwith -%}
{% endblock content %}
